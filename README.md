BLACKOUT PROTOCOL

This is a bachelor thesis project by Nikita Sumahers and Hans Ivar Gr√∏nli

The idea of this system is to detect sleeping, unconscious or unaware drivers and prevent accidents
The system takes the current image of the driver and acceleration of the vehicle as input
calculates it with variable time and output a danger level, then it decides on action depending on variables and danger level

Dependencies:
    
    tensorflow
    cv2
    numpy
    imutils
    scikit-fuzzy

Thanks to:

Adrian Rosebrock from pyimagesearch.com for many tutorials for cv2 and face recognition

Kavin Sharma for simple python car game that we edited and used for the demo

Harrison Kinsley (santdex) for YouTube tutorials on analyzing models with TensorBoard

All the people from the images we used to train our model
